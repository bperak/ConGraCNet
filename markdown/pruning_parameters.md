>Pruning parameters determine the pruning of the second degree graph. You can select  `Betweenness percentile` parameters, `Degree pruned` and `Partition type for pruned graph`. If you choose a `cpm` option, an additional slider with  `Resolution for pruned graph (0-low, 1-high)` is enabled, giving you the option to refine or engross the communities in the pruned graph.
