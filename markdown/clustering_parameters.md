>You can choose between Leiden (https://github.com/vtraag/leidenalg) and Louvain (https://github.com/vtraag/louvain-igraph) implementation of the community detection algorithm for the Igraph Python library (https://igraph.org/python/) in the `Cluster algorithm type`.  The coocurrences are acquired by a measure set in the `Measure` selection box. If there are not enough available data about the source word in the local database you can harvest the data by checking `Initial data harvest`. Similarly, you can harvest coocurrences data by checking `Friend harvesting option`. You can set additional parameters by checking `Set minimal frequency and score`.
