>You can `Choose a grammatical relation` between source lexeme and collocated friend lexeme from a drop-down menu. For a given source lexeme in a corpus, the algorithm yields strongly associated communities of collocation lexemes. By projecting semantic value to a syntactical relation, the syntactic-based networks represent different semantic structures in the corpus. The grammatical relations have been defined in the Sketch Grammars. Initial grammar relation is always `coordination` related construction. You can also `Filter the pos value of the collocated lexeme` for grammatical relations that yield more than one friend lexeme part of speech values.
