>You can create a network by choosing a number of coocurrences set in the `Friend coocurences`. The coocurrences are acquired by a measure set in the `Measure` selection box. If there are not enough available data about the source word in the local database you can harvest the data by checking `Initial data harvest`. Similarly, you can harvest coocurrences data by checking `Friend harvesting option`. You can set additional parameters by checking `Set minimal frequency and score`.
